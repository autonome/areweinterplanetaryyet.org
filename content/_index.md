### The [IPFS][] protocol stands for InterPlanetary File System, but when will it actually be used in Space?

The first confirmed mission to use IPFS was [announced][] in January 2023 by the
[Filecoin Foundation][] and [Lockheed Martin][]. The implementation designed for this is
[Myceli][], a minimal IPFS system written in Rust, and developed by [Little Bear Labs][].

Come join us in [#space on Filecoin Slack][], and watch this site for more updates soon.
